Structured Implementation Plan for Heron File Classifier
Objective
Enhance the file classifier to handle poorly named files, scale to new industries, and process large document volumes efficiently while ensuring robustness and maintainability.

Phase 1: Enhancing the Classifier
1.1 File Type Detection & Handling
✅ Detect file types using python-magic or filetype to determine how to process each file (PDF, Word, Excel, Image, etc.).
✅ Implement handlers for different file types:

PDFs: Extract text using pdfplumber or PyMuPDF.

Word Documents: Use python-docx.

Excel Files: Use pandas (read_excel).

Images (Scanned Docs, Screenshots): Use OCR (pytesseract).
✅ Implement a fallback mechanism:

If text extraction fails, use filename heuristics and metadata analysis (size, format, date created).

1.2 Machine Learning-Based Classification
✅ Train a text classification model:

Use pretrained transformers (BERT, DistilBERT) or TF-IDF + Naïve Bayes for simpler models.

If no training data is available, generate synthetic labeled data for industry-specific document types.
✅ Implement a hybrid classification approach:

Primary classification: Uses extracted text.

Fallback classification: Uses filename heuristics and metadata.

Phase 2: Scaling for Large Volumes
2.1 Batch Processing & Parallelization
✅ Implement batch processing so multiple files can be classified in one request.
✅ Use multiprocessing or Ray to parallelize text extraction and classification.
✅ Implement an asynchronous task queue (Celery, RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle large-scale document ingestion.

2.2 Industry Adaptability
✅ Create a pluggable architecture where new industry models can be easily integrated.
✅ Design a configuration-based pipeline so new classification rules/models can be added without code changes.
✅ Store classification results in a database (PostgreSQL, DynamoDB) to track document history and improve predictions over time.

Phase 3: Productionization
3.1 Robustness & Reliability
✅ Implement structured logging (loguru, Sentry) for monitoring failures.
✅ Add retry logic for temporary failures (e.g., network issues, OCR failures).
✅ Ensure the service handles edge cases, such as corrupt files or unsupported formats.

3.2 Testing & CI/CD
✅ Write unit tests for file processing and classification logic.
✅ Implement integration tests to validate full workflow.
✅ Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

3.3 Deployment & Scalability
✅ Containerize the application using Docker.
✅ Deploy to AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, or Kubernetes based on scale requirements.
✅ Set up auto-scaling to handle high loads dynamically.
